# Code of Conduct

We are committed to providing a welcoming, harassment-free experience for everyone who participates in this organization. All contributors, maintainers, and users are expected to uphold the values of respect, inclusion, and collaboration.

## Our Standards

- Be empathetic, respectful, and open to differing viewpoints.
- Provide constructive feedback and accept it gracefully.
- Use inclusive language and avoid personal attacks or derogatory comments.
- Focus on what is best for the community, users, and project quality.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies to all organization spaces, both online and in person, including repositories, issue trackers, community events, and private communications related to project work.

## Reporting

Report unacceptable behavior to the maintainers at `security@example.org`. Include all relevant details so we can investigate quickly and confidentially. See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for escalation paths.

## Enforcement

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing this Code of Conduct. Actions may include warnings, temporary bans, permanent removal from organization spaces, or other responses deemed appropriate.

## Attribution

This policy is inspired by the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) v2.1. When in doubt, err on the side of kindness and reach out for help.

For guidance on collaborating effectively, review our [CONTRIBUTING guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md), [support expectations](SUPPORT.md), and the [AI operating manual](docs/ai/codex-operating-manual.md).
