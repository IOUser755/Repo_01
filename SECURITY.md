# Security Policy

We take the security of our users and data seriously. Please follow these guidelines to report vulnerabilities and keep our systems safe.

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are applied to the most recent major release of each actively maintained project. Older releases may receive fixes on a best-effort basis depending on severity and feasibility.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

- Email `security@example.org` with details about the vulnerability.
- Include steps to reproduce, affected versions or repositories, and any potential impact.
- Do **not** open public issues for undisclosed security problems.
- If encrypted communication is required, request our PGP key in your initial email.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within two business days and provide regular status updates until resolution.

## Preferred Handling Process

1. We review and validate the report.
2. We coordinate a remediation plan and timeline with you, including optional credit.
3. We announce the fix once mitigation is available for users.

## Responsible Disclosure

Please give us a reasonable chance to fix issues before sharing them publicly. We value collaboration with the security community and credit reporters in release notes when possible.

For additional guidance on participating in this organization, read our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md), [Support policy](SUPPORT.md), and [AI operating manual](docs/ai/codex-operating-manual.md).
